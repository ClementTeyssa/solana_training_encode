# Exercise 1 - Decentralised Systems

1. Fill in the Sli.do [Poll](https://app.sli.do/event/oy4nETsfVexoK6NRApp3V9) about your goals for this course
2. Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

   Consider

   - What are the essential pieces of functionality ?
   - How could people cheat ?
   - How could you prevent them from cheating ?

   This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any design.

3. Do you feel that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a move towards decentralisation? Will they help or hinder adoption of other cryptocurrencies?
4. Listen to the Zero knowledge [episode](https://zeroknowledge.fm/135-2/) about Solana
