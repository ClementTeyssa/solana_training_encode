### Coding Challenge

# Reverse an Array

Here's a simple puzzle to get you more familair with Rust and it's methods.

```
fn main() {

    let mut array = [1, 2, 3, 4,];

    // add your code here
    println!("{:?}", array);

}
```

Feel free to set it up in your own environment and try it locally if you have it already set up. Otherwise try it on Rust playground: [Reversing an Array in Rust](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=02b1fd45e606bf3d4963df84ca766aae)
