# Exercise 4

## Sending lamports

Using the command line tool, send your colleagues some lamports. Check your balance and your colleagues balance before and after.

## Fizz buzz program

1. Create a project called bootcamp using Cargo
2. The main function should print a welcome message.
3. Write a 'fizz buzz' function that will be called from your main function.

- The function should have a loop counting up to 301
- If the count is divisible by 3, print "fizz"
- If the count is divisible by 5 print "buzz"
- If the count is divisible by 3 and 5 print "fizz buzz"
- At the end print the number of times "fizz buzz" occurred.

Answer is 20

## Extra Credit

If the Fizz Buzz program was no sweat here's an additional challenge for you to have fun with.

# Two Sum

We have Vector of integers called `nums` and a `target` integer. Return the two indices that add up to the `target` value.

Rules:

- There’s always one unique solution for each list.
- You can’t use the same number twice.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output:[1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

```
fn two_sum(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32> {

    // your code goes here
}

fn main() {

    println!("{:?}", two_sum(vec![2, 3, 4, 5,], 9));
}
```

There's a brute force solution that's a bit easier to figure out, but see if you can also use a HashMap for a more efficient solution.
