# Exercise 5

We will do exercises in this [repo](https://github.com/ExtropyIO/SolanaBootcamp) The rust exercises are in a folder `homework_rust`

1. Install the exercises and fix the path

   ```
   cargo install --force --path .
   ```

2. Run interactive homework window

```
rustlings homework 5
```

The current exercise is stated in the hint command, below for example it is exercise

```
option2
```

```
 2 |  // Make me compile! Execute `rustlings hint option2` for hints
 3 |
 4 |  // I AM NOT DONE
 5 |
```

The shell will display which exercises has either failed at compilation or at testing.

Modify the file and if it passes all the tests remove this line:

```
// I AM NOT DONE
```

That will take you to the next file to fix.

The exercises are based on the rustlings exercises, but I have adapted them to follow the lessons.

You can use this [gitpod environment](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ExtropyIO/SolanaBootcamp)
