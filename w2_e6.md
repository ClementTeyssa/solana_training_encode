## Coding Challenge

If you've already finished the Rustling's homework heres' an extra coding challenge.

# Running Sum of 1D Vector

Given a vector `nums`, create a new vector called `runningSum` where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the beginning of the vector up to index `i`.

Return the running sum of `nums`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
```

```
fn running_sum(nums: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    // Your code here
}

fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", running_sum(vec![1, 1, 1, 1, 1]));
}
```

See if you can figure out a "Rusty" way to do it using Rust's iterators and methods.
